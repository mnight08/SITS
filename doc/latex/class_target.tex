\subsection{Detailed Description}
A target represents a physical entity that we would scatter an incident field. Currently, targets are assumed stationary. Subclasses include sampled targets, and function targets. A function target takes in a point and returns the reflectivity at that point. A sampled target is a discrete representation of the physical entity we are modeling.
